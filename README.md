## üåø Plant Co. Performance Report : Power BI Dashboard

### Project Overview
This Power BI project showcases a dynamic, interactive dashboard built to analyze and track key performance metrics ‚Äî Sales, Gross Profit, and Quantity ‚Äî for Plant Co.. The report is designed with SWITCH logic, dynamic visuals, and time intelligence measures to provide business stakeholders with an intuitive performance overview and actionable insights.

üìÅ Project Structure
1. Data Preparation (Power Query)

- Loaded and renamed tables (dim_ for dimensions, fact_ for facts).
- Cleaned the data: removed duplicates, renamed columns, corrected datatypes.
- Created a custom date table using:
  ```dax
  Dim_Date = CALENDAR(DATE(2022,01,01), DATE(2024,12,31))
  ```


- Added an Inpast column to identify previous year‚Äôs dates for PYTD calculations.

2. Data Modeling

- Created a Slc_Values table with toggle options: Sales, Gross Profit, Quantity.
- Developed a _Measures table with folders:
- Base Measures: Sales, Quantity, COGS, Gross Profit
- YTD / PYTD Measures: Using TOTALYTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR
- SWITCH Logic for dynamic visual toggling:
```dax
S_PYTD = 
VAR selected_value = SELECTEDVALUE(Slc_Values[Values])
RETURN SWITCH(selected_value,
    "Sales", [PYTD_Sales],
    "Quantity", [PYTD_Quantity],
    "Gross Profit", [PYTD_GrossProfit]
)
```


- Built relationships between fact and dimension tables.

  3. Visuals & Layout
     
- Visuals: Cards, Tree Map, Waterfall Chart, Combo Chart, Scatter Plot (with Zoom Slider).
- Added dynamic chart titles using measures, e.g.:


```dax
_Waterfall Title = SELECTEDVALUE(Slc_Values[Values]) & " YTD vs PYTD | Month - Country - Product"
```



- Added Gross Profit %:

```dax
GP% = DIVIDE([Gross Profit], [Sales])
```

4. Review & Enhancements
   
- Measures organized in folders for better structure.
- Final polish: formatting, axis titles, conditional formatting.
- Created a dynamic report title:


```dax
_Report Title = "Plant Co. " & SELECTEDVALUE(Slc_Values[Values]) & " Performance " & SELECTEDVALUE(Dim_Date[Date].[Year])
```


5. Tools & Techniques

- Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualization)
- Power Query (Data Cleaning)
- Time Intelligence (YTD, PYTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR)
- Dynamic Titles & Conditional Formatting
- SWITCH logic for custom measure selection

‚úÖ Key Features & Outcomes

- Interactive metric selection using slicers and SWITCH logic.
- YTD vs PYTD analysis across time, geography, and product.
- Dynamic titles and visuals adjust automatically based on user input.
- Profitability insights via scatter plot segmentation and GP%.
- Stakeholder Benefits

‚úÖ This dashboard helps Plant Co. decision-makers:

- Monitor and compare current vs past year performance.
- Identify growth areas and operational inefficiencies.
